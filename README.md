# Update the title for pic18f46q71-curiosity-hpc-demo-code here

The following labs in this demo code project are designed for Microchip’s Curiosity High Pin Count (HPC) Development board. This development board supports Microchip's 28 and 40-pin 8-bit PIC® MCUs. This MPLAB X project contains several lab exercises that demonstrate a large number of basic capabilities of PIC® devices and can also be used to test the condition of the board. Each lab contains a brief description of the lab and discussions to make you become easily acquainted with the different peripherals and registers of PIC® MCUs. These labs also make use of the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC), an easy-to-use plugin tool for MPLAB X IDE. MCC can be used to setup the peripherals and also generates drivers which can be used in the application code. All labs are written in C language and are compatible with the latest XC8 compilers.
